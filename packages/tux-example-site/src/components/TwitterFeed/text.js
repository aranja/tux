  'The training on Tux is so simple, it’s so easy to use. And from the customer’s standpoint it’s very intuitive.',
  'Our favorite part of Tux is that it actually runs behind our own website, very efficiently, but our brand stays at the forefront.',
  'We’re a really busy restaurant, and Tux gives our customers a really easy way to order, pay, and pick up their food so they can beat the line and beat that lunch rush.',
  'We’ve increased our sales from 20–25% since we’ve implemented Tux and would never look back.',
  'It really streamlines our delivery and pickup service. Regular customers have been ordering more often and their orders have been larger.',
  'We use the Tux Dashboard whenever there’s menu changes, time changes due to holidays, or whenever we’re running a new promotion.',
  'With Tux it’s quicker with the customer, the customer is more ensured of getting exactly what they ordered, and I’m all for the efficiency',
  'Our online ordering has increased about 4x in the past 3–4 years and Tux has made it easier and more efficient to get orders through. It fits right into the operational flow',
  'Life before Tux was very chaotic — we got a lot of phone calls, a lot of mistyped orders. So with ChowNow, the ability to see the order directly from the customer makes it so streamlined'
